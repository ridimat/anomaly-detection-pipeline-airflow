# anomaly-detection-pipeline-airflow
ðŸš¨ Anomaly Detection Pipeline using Apache Airflow
This project automates the end-to-end pipeline of fetching real-time public safety data, detecting geographic anomalies, and storing the results â€” all orchestrated using Apache Airflow and containerized with Docker.

ðŸ§  What It Does
Fetches public safety incident data hourly from San Francisco's open data API

Cleans and processes the data using Python

Applies Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn) to detect anomalies based on latitude & longitude

Stores both clean and anomalous records into CSV files (or PostgreSQL optionally)

Runs entirely through scheduled tasks in Airflow, isolated inside Docker containers
